# PropertyFunctions.jl

This package provides functionality for easy access to and efficient broadcasting over properties.

PropertyFunctions defines the macro [`@pf`](@ref) that can be used to quicky access properties of objects and
broadcast efficiently over collections of objects, e.g. via `xs .|> @pf $a + $c^2`.

The package also provides convencience functions [`sortby`](@ref) and [`filterby`](@ref) that work well with functions generated by `@pf` (but are compatible with generic functions as well).
